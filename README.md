# Movie_Website
This repository contains all the files needed to access my movie website for Udacity's Full Stack developer [Nano Degree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004). It opens up a tab in the user's web browser and show cases the movies in my entertainment_center file. If the user clicks on the movie poster a trailer will pop-up and play. 

## Installation Instructions

### Additional installations & Running the website
-Other things this project requires is Python 2.7 which can be [downloaded here](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/).

  * Alternatively if you use Ubuntu 16.04, then you can download Python 2.7 using the following terminal command                 ```sudo apt-get      install python```
